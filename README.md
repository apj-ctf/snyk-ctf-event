# Snyk CTF Event: Multi-Challenge Repository

This repository contains multiple folders, each representing a separate GitHub repository and challenge for the Snyk CTF event. Each folder includes the full source code for its respective vulnerability challenge.

## Getting Started

You can clone this entire repository to your IDE (such as GitHub Codespaces or VS Code) to access all the challenges in one place:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

## Using Snyk to Find Vulnerabilities

Once cloned, use the Snyk plugin in your IDE to scan all the folders and quickly identify vulnerabilities across all challenges.

- **VS Code**: Install the Snyk extension and run a scan.
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Go to the "Code" section in GitHub and create a new Codespaces instance. The environment is preconfigured with:
  - Snyk plugin
  - Terminal for running curl commands
  - Postman extension for API endpoint testing
  - Other useful tools for CTF

Everything you need to find the flags in the challenges is ready to go!

## Structure

- Each folder is a standalone challenge with its own codebase.
- You can work on each challenge independently or all at once.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open in Codespaces or VS Code.
3. Use Snyk to scan for vulnerabilities.
4. Use the terminal and Postman extension to interact with the challenges and find flags.

## Note

This repo is designed for security training and CTF purposes. Do not use in production.
